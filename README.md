# COMP2230
University of Newcastle - Algorithms - 2022

Algorithms explored several important algorithms and datastructures looking at how they worked, their effeciency and their common uses.

This repository contains

  - Assignment 1: A program which both generates and solves mazes
  - Playground: A fun place where all of the algorithms taught across the course are implemented and tested. There is no serious structure to this folder.
